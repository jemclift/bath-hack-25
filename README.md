## Inspiration

If you've ever burnt your textbook after an exam or angrily torn up a letter, you've experienced the cathartic feeling of destroying an object symbolic of your problems.

With all the stresses that particularly young people feel these days, we wanted to create a fun and risk-free app to help us all let off some steam.

## What it does

You tell us what's been troubling you; what's on your mind?
We use OpenAI's generative AI to create an image that represents your problems...
... and then **you shred it!**

## Challenges we ran into

- Creating satisfying CSS effects
- Prompt engineering representative images
- Limited experience using Flask

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- The UI! We think it looks really cool, we're big fans of the retro aesthetic
- Hopefully helping people feel a little better about their problems
